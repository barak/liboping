liboping (1.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Disable the "-f" command line option (read hosts from a file) if the
      real and affective user IDs don't match (e.g. when running setuid),
      unless "-" (STDIN) has been specified; thanks a lot to Steve Kemp for
      reporting this (Closes: #548684).

liboping (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added liboping0.symbols:
    - Use 0.3.2 as MINVER for all symbols - all symbols exist since 0.1.0 but
      0.3.2 is the first version that introduced a SONAME version.
    - Use 'Build-Depends-Package: liboping-dev' to let a user specify the
      minimal version required for optional features.
  * debian/rules:
    - Do not ignore 'make clean' errors.
    - Use config.{guess,sub} provided by autotools-dev to fix a FTBFS on
      avr32, thanks to Bradley Smith for reporting this (Closes: #529460).
    - Use dh_install's --fail-missing instead of --list-missing.
    - Pass CFLAGS as arguments to configure instead of setting them in the
      environment - this is the recommended way.
    - Remove manpages to force a rebuild to avoid errors from man.
  * debian/control:
    - Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version}.
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.8.2.
    - Added Homepage and Vcs-{Git,Browser} fields.
    - Removed duplicate field "Section" for package "liboping0".
    - Added versioned build dependency on dpkg-dev (>= 1.14.13) to support the
      Homepage and Vcs-* fields and Build-Depends-Package.
    - Let the -dev package depend on a strict version of the lib package - the
      -dev package includes a symlink to the full soname, not only the major
      version.
    - Let the binary packages oping and libnet-oping-perl depend on liboping0
      (>= ${source:Upstream-Version}) explicitly since we do not want to build
      depend on liboping-dev to get the right version through 'Build-Depends-
      Package'.
    - Build depend on perl, required for pod2man.
  * debian/compat:
    - Updated to compat version 5.
  * Added new binary package "libnet-oping-perl":
    - Since Net::Oping uses its own version number, $srcver-$perlver-$debrev
      is used for the package version.
    - Added libnet-oping-perl.install.
    - Build-depend on perl-modules - debian/rules now requires the ExtUtils:MM
      module.
  * debian/liboping0.shlibs:
    - Updated version to >= 1.3.0.
  * Added debian/README.Debian:
    - Added a note explaining the use of the 'Build-Depends-Package' field.
